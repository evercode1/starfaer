        'A-type main-sequence star' => 'An A-type main-sequence star 
                                        or A dwarf star is a main-sequence 
                                        hydrogen-burning star of spectral 
                                        type A and luminosity class V. These 
                                        stars have spectra which are defined 
                                        by strong hydrogen Balmer absorption 
                                        lines. They have masses from 1.4 to 
                                        2.1 times the mass of the Sun and surface 
                                        temperatures between 7600 and 11 500 K.

                                        Sirius A, and Vega. A-type stars are 
                                        fully radiative and thus are not 
                                        expected to harbor a magnetic dynamo. 
                                        As a consequence, because they do not 
                                        have strong stellar winds they lack a 
                                        means to generate X-ray emission.

        'Am star' => 'An Am star or metallic-line star is a type of chemically 
        peculiar star of spectral type A whose spectrum has strong and often 
        variable absorption lines of metals such as zinc, strontium, zirconium, 
        and barium, and deficiencies of others, such as calcium and scandium. 
        The original definition of an Am star was one in which the star shows 
        an apparent surface underabundance of Ca and/or Sc and/or an apparent 
        overabundance of the Fe group and heavier elements.

        The unusual relative abundances cause the spectral type assessed from 
        the Calcium K lines to be systematically earlier than one assessed 
        from other metallic lines. Typically, a spectral type judged solely 
        from hydrogen lines is intermediate. This leads to two or three 
        spectral types being given. For example, Sirius has been given a 
        spectral type of kA0hA0VmA1, indicating that it is A0 when judged 
        by the Calcium k line, A0V when judge by its hydrogen lines, 
        and A1 when judged by the lines of heavy metals. 
        There are other formats, such as A0mA1Va, again for Sirius.

        The chemical abnormalities are due to some elements which absorb 
        more light being pushed towards the surface, while others sink 
        under the force of gravity. This effect takes place only if the 
        star has low rotational velocity. Normally, A-type stars rotate 
        quickly. Most Am stars form part of a binary system in which the 
        rotation of the stars has been slowed by tidal braking.

        The best-known metallic-line star is Sirius α Canis Majoris. The 
        following table lists some metallic-line stars in order of descending 
        apparent visual magnitude.',

        'Ap and Bp stars' => 'Ap and Bp stars are chemically peculiar stars hence 
        the p of types A and B which show overabundances of some metals, such 
        as strontium, chromium and europium. In addition, larger overabundances 
        are often seen in praseodymium and neodymium. These stars have a much 
        slower rotation than normal for A and B-type stars, although some 
        exhibit rotation velocities up to about 100 kilometers per second.
        They also have stronger magnetic fields than classical A- or B-type 
        stars in the case of HD 215441, reaching 33.5 kG 3.35 T. Typically 
        the magnetic field of these stars lies in the range of a few kG to 
        tens of kG. In most cases a field which is modelled as a simple 
        dipole is a good approximation and provides an explanation as to 
        why there is an apparent periodic variation in the magnetic field, 
        as if such a field is not aligned with the rotation axis—the field 
        strength will change as the star rotates. In support of this theory 
        it has been noted that the variations in magnetic field are 
        inversely correlated with the rotation velocity. 
        This model of a dipolar field, in which the magnetic 
        axis is offset to the rotation axis, is known as the 
        oblique rotator model.',


        'B-type main-sequence star' => 'A B-type main-sequence star B V is a main-sequence 
        hydrogen-burning star of spectral type B and luminosity class V. These stars have 
        from 2 to 16 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 10,000 
        and 30,000 K. B-type stars are extremely luminous and blue. Their spectra have 
        neutral helium, which are most prominent at the B2 subclass, and moderate hydrogen 
        lines. Examples include Regulus and Algol A.

        This class of stars was introduced with the Harvard sequence of stellar spectra 
        and published in the Revised Harvard photometry catalogue. The definition of type 
        B-type stars was the presence of non-ionized helium lines with the absence of 
        singly ionized helium in the blue-violet portion of the spectrum. All of the 
        spectral classes, including the B type, were subdivided with a numerical suffix 
        that indicated the degree to which they approached the next classification. Thus 
        B2 is two tenths of the way from type B or B0 to type A.',

        'Barium star' => 'Barium stars are spectral class G to K giants, whose spectra indicate 
        an overabundance of s-process elements by the presence of singly ionized barium, 
        Ba II, at λ 455.4 nm. Barium stars also show enhanced spectral features of carbon, 
        the bands of the molecules CH, CN and C2. The class was originally recognized and 
        defined by William P. Bidelman and Philip Keenan.

        Observational studies of their radial velocity suggested that all barium stars 
        are binary stars. Observations in the ultraviolet using International Ultraviolet 
        Explorer detected white dwarfs in some barium star systems.

        Barium stars are believed to be the result of mass transfer in a binary star system. 
        The mass transfer occurred when the now-observed giant star was on the main sequence. 
        Its companion, the donor star, was a carbon star on the asymptotic giant branch AGB, 
        and had produced carbon and s-process elements in its interior. These nuclear fusion 
        products were mixed by convection to its surface. Some of that matter polluted the surface 
        layers of the main-sequence star as the donor star lost mass at the end of its AGB evolution, 
        and it subsequently evolved to become a white dwarf. These systems are being observed 
        at an indeterminate amount of time after the mass transfer event, when the donor star 
        has long been a white dwarf, and the polluted recipient star has evolved to become a red giant.

        During its evolution, the barium star will at times be larger and cooler than the 
        limits of the spectral types G or K. When this happens, ordinarily such a star 
        is spectral type M, but its s-process excesses may cause it to show its altered 
        composition as another spectral peculiarity. While the stars surface temperature 
        is in the M-type regime, the star may show molecular features of the s-process 
        element zirconium, zirconium oxide ZrO bands. When this happens, the star will 
        appear as an extrinsic S star.

        Historically, barium stars posed a puzzle, because in standard stellar evolution 
        theory G and K giants are not far enough along in their evolution to have synthesized 
        carbon and s-process elements and mix them to their surfaces. The discovery of the stars
        binary nature resolved the puzzle, putting the source of their spectral peculiarities 
        into a companion star which should have produced such material. The mass transfer e
        pisode is believed to be quite brief on an astronomical timescale. The mass transfer 
        hypothesis predicts that there should be main-sequence stars with barium star 
        spectral peculiarities. At least one such star, HR 107, is known.

        Prototypical barium stars include zeta Capricorni, HR 774, and HR 4474.

        The CH stars are Population II stars with similar evolutionary state, 
        spectral peculiarities, and orbital statistics, and are believed to be 
        the older, metal-poor analogs of the barium stars.',

        'B e star' => 'Nebulosity around the Be star HD 87643.  A B e star, frequently 
        called a B e-type star, is a B-type star with distinctive forbidden neutral 
        or low ionisation emission lines in its spectrum. The designation results 
        from combining the spectral class B, the lowercase e denoting emission 
        in the spectral classification system, and the surrounding square brackets 
        signifying forbidden lines. These stars frequently also show strong 
        hydrogen emission lines, but this feature is present in a variety of other 
        stars and is not sufficient to classify a B e object. Other observational 
        characteristics include optical linear polarization and often infrared 
        radiation that is much stronger than in ordinary B-class stars, 
        called infrared excess. As the B e nature is transient, Be-type stars 
        might exhibit a normal B-type spectrum at times, and hitherto normal 
        B-type stars may become B e-type stars.',

        'Be star' => 'Be Stars are a heterogeneous set of stars with B spectral types 
        and emission lines. A narrower definition, sometimes referred to as Classical 
        Be Stars, is a non-supergiant B star whose spectrum has, or had at some time, 
        one or more Balmer emission lines.
        Many stars have B-type spectra and show hydrogen emission lines, 
        including many supergiants, Herbig Ae/Be stars, mass-transferring binary 
        systems, and B e stars. It is preferred to restrict usage of the term Be star 
        to non-supergiant stars showing one or more Balmer series lines in emission. 
        These are sometimes referred to as classical Be stars. The emission lines may 
        be present only at certain times.

       Although the B e type spectrum is most strongly produced in class B stars, it is 
       also detected in O and A shell stars, and these are sometimes included under 
       the Be star banner. Be stars are primarily considered to be main sequence stars, 
       but a number of subgiants and giant stars are also included.',

        'Binary pulsar' => 'A binary pulsar is a pulsar with a binary companion, often a 
        white dwarf or neutron star. In at least one case, the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, 
        the companion neutron star is another pulsar as well. Binary pulsars are one of 
        the few objects which allow physicists to test general relativity because of the 
        strong gravitational fields in their vicinities. Although the binary companion to 
        the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe directly, its presence 
        can be deduced from the timing of the pulses from the pulsar itself, which can 
        be measured with extraordinary accuracy by radio telescopes.',

        'Binary star' => 'A binary star is a star system consisting of two stars orbiting around their 
        common barycenter. Systems of two or more stars are called multiple star systems. These 
        systems, especially when more distant, often appear to the unaided eye as a single point 
        of light, and are then revealed as multiple by other means. Research over the last two 
        centuries suggests that half or more of visible stars are part of multiple star systems.

        The term double star is often used synonymously with binary star; however, double star 
        can also mean optical double star. Optical doubles are so called because the two stars 
        appear close together in the sky as seen from the Earth; they are almost on the same 
        line of sight. Nevertheless, their doubleness depends only on this optical effect; the 
        stars themselves are distant from one another and share no physical connection. A double 
        star can be revealed as optical by means of differences in their parallax measurements, 
        proper motions, or radial velocities. Most known double stars have not been studied sufficiently 
        closely to determine whether they are optical doubles or they are doubles physically bound 
        through gravitation into a multiple star system.

        Binary star systems are very important in astrophysics because calculations of their orbits 
        allow the masses of their component stars to be directly determined, which in turn allows 
        other stellar parameters, such as radius and density, to be indirectly estimated. This also 
        determines an empirical mass-luminosity relationship (MLR) from which the masses of single 
        stars can be estimated.

        Binary stars are often detected optically, in which case they are called visual binaries. 
        Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and 
        therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. They may also be detected by 
        indirect techniques, such as spectroscopy spectroscopic binaries or astrometry astrometric 
        binaries. If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along our line of sight, its components 
        will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called eclipsing binaries, or, as 
        they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, photometric 
        binaries.

        If components in binary star systems are close enough they can gravitationally distort their 
        mutual outer stellar atmospheres. In some cases, these close binary systems can exchange mass, 
        which may bring their evolution to stages that single stars cannot attain. Examples of 
        binaries are Sirius, and Cygnus X-1 Cygnus X-1 being a well-known black hole. Binary stars 
        are also common as the nuclei of many planetary nebulae, and are the 
        progenitors of both novae and type Ia supernovae.',

        'Black dwarf' => 'A black dwarf is a theoretical stellar remnant, specifically a white 
        dwarf that has cooled sufficiently that it no longer emits significant heat or light. 
        Because the time required for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be 
        longer than the current age of the universe 13.8 billion years, no black dwarfs are 
        expected to exist in the universe now, and the temperature of the coolest white dwarfs 
        is one observational limit on the age of the universe.

        The name black dwarf has also been applied to substellar objects that do not have sufficient 
        mass, less than approximately 0.08 M☉, to maintain hydrogen-burning nuclear fusion. 
        These objects are now generally called brown dwarfs, a term coined in the 1970s.
        Black dwarfs should not be confused with black holes, black stars, or neutron stars.',

        'Black star semiclassical gravity' => 'A black star is a gravitational object composed 
        of matter. It is a theoretical alternative to the black hole concept from general 
        relativity. The theoretical construct was created through the use of semiclassical 
        gravity theory. A similar structure should also exist for the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations 
        system, which is the superclassical limit of quantum electrodynamics, and for 
        the Einstein–Yang–Mills–Dirac system, which is the superclassical limit of the standard model.

        A black star need not have an event horizon, and may or may not be a transitional phase 
        between a collapsing star and a singularity. A black star is created when matter 
        compresses at a rate significantly less than the freefall velocity of a hypothetical 
        particle falling to the center of its star, because quantum processes create vacuum 
        polarization, which creates a form of degeneracy pressure, preventing spacetime and 
        the particles held within it from occupying the same space at the same time. 
        This vacuum energy is theoretically unlimited, and if built up quickly enough, 
        will stop gravitational collapse from creating a singularity. This may entail 
        an ever-decreasing rate of collapse, leading to an infinite collapse time, or 
        asymptotically approaching a radius less than zero.

        A black star with a radius slightly greater than the predicted event horizon 
        for an equivalent-mass black hole will appear very dark, because almost all 
        light produced will be drawn back to the star, and any escaping light will 
        be severely gravitationally redshifted. It will appear almost exactly like a black hole. 
        It will feature Hawking radiation, as virtual particle pairs created in its vicinity 
        may still be split, with one particle escaping and the other being trapped.
         Additionally, it will create thermal Planckian radiation that will closely 
         resemble the expected Hawking radiation of an equivalent black hole.',

        'Blue dwarf red-dwarf stage' => 'A blue dwarf is a predicted class of star 
        that develops from a red dwarf after it has exhausted much of its hydrogen 
        fuel supply. Because red dwarfs fuse their hydrogen slowly and are fully 
        convective allowing their entire hydrogen supply to be fused, instead of 
        merely that in the core, the Universe is currently not old enough for any 
        blue dwarfs to have formed yet, but their future existence is predicted 
        based on theoretical models.

        Stars increase in luminosity as they age, and a more luminous star needs to 
        radiate energy more quickly to maintain equilibrium. Stars larger than red 
        dwarfs do this by increasing their size and becoming red giants with larger 
        surface areas. Rather than expanding, however, red dwarfs with less than 
        0.25 solar masses are predicted to increase their radiative rate by increasing 
        their surface temperatures and becoming bluer. This is because the surface 
        layers of red dwarfs do not become significantly more opaque with 
        increasing temperature.

        Blue dwarfs eventually evolve into white dwarfs once their hydrogen fuel is 
        completely exhausted, which in turn will eventually cool to become a black dwarf.',

        'Blue giant' => 'In astronomy, a blue giant is a hot star with a luminosity class 
        of III giant or II bright giant. In the standard Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, 
        these stars lie above and to the right of the main sequence.

        The term applies to a variety of stars in different phases of development, 
        all evolved stars that have moved from the main sequence but have little else 
        in common, so blue giant simply refers to stars in a particular region of the 
        HR diagram rather than a specific type of star. They are much rarer than red giants, 
        because they only develop from more massive and less common stars, 
        and because they have short lives in the blue giant stage.

        The name blue giant is sometimes misapplied to other high-mass luminous stars, 
        such as main-sequence stars, simply because they are large and hot.',

        'Blue hypergiant' => 'Luminous blue variables are a class of highly luminous 
        hot stars that display characteristic spectral variation. They often lie in a 
        quiescent zone with hotter stars generally being more luminous, but periodically 
        undergo large surface eruptions and move to a narrow zone where stars of all 
        luminosities have approximately the same temperature, around 8,000K. This active 
        zone is near the hot edge of the unstable void where yellow hypergiants are 
        found, with some overlap. It is not clear whether yellow hypergiants ever manage 
        to get past the instability void to become LBVs or explode as a supernova.

        Blue hypergiants are found in the same parts of the HR diagram as LBVs but do not 
        necessarily show the LBV variations. Some but not all LBVs show the characteristics of 
        hypergiant spectra at least some of the time, but many authors would exclude all 
        LBVs from the hypergiant class and treat them separately. Blue hypergiants that 
        do not show LBV characteristics may be progenitors of LBVs, or vice versa, or both. 
        Lower mass LBVs may be a transitional stage to or from cool hypergiants or are 
        different type of object.',

        'Blue straggler' => 'A blue straggler is a main-sequence star in an open or globular 
        cluster that is more luminous and bluer than stars at the main-sequence turn-off 
        point for the cluster. Blue stragglers were first discovered by Allan Sandage in 
        1953 while performing photometry of the stars in the globular cluster M3. 
        Standard theories of stellar evolution hold that the position of a star on the 
        Hertzsprung–Russell diagram should be determined almost entirely by the initial 
        mass of the star and its age. In a cluster, stars all formed at approximately 
        the same time, and thus in an H–R diagram for a cluster, all stars should 
        lie along a clearly defined curve set by the age of the cluster, with the 
        positions of individual stars on that curve determined solely by their initial 
        mass. With masses two to three times that of the rest of the main-sequence 
        cluster stars, blue stragglers seem to be exceptions to this rule. 
        The resolution of this problem is likely related to interactions between 
        two or more stars in the dense confines of the clusters in which blue stragglers are found.',

        'Blue supergiant star' => 'Blue supergiant stars are hot luminous stars, 
        referred to scientifically as OB supergiants. They have luminosity class I 
        and spectral class B9 or earlier.

        Blue supergiants BSGs are found towards the top left of the Hertzsprung–Russell 
        diagram to the right of the main sequence. They are larger than the Sun but smaller 
        than a red supergiant, with surface temperatures of 10,000–50,000 K and luminosities 
        from about 10,000 to a million times the Sun.',

        'Bright giant' => 'The luminosity class II in the Yerkes spectral classification is 
        given to bright giants. These are stars which straddle the boundary between ordinary 
        giants and supergiants, based on the appearance of their spectra.',

        'Brown dwarf' => 'Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that occupy the mass range between 
        the heaviest gas giant planets and the lightest stars, having masses between 
        approximately 13 to 75–80 times that of Jupiter MJ, or approximately 2.5×1028 kg to 
        about 1.5×1029 kg. Below this range are the sub-brown dwarfs, and above it are 
        the lightest red dwarfs M9 V. Brown dwarfs may be fully convective, with no 
        layers or chemical differentiation by depth.

        Unlike the stars in the main sequence, brown dwarfs are not massive enough to 
        sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen 1H to helium in their cores. 
        They are, however, thought to fuse deuterium 2H and to fuse lithium 7Li if 
        their mass is above a debated threshold of 13 MJ and 65 MJ, respectively.
        It is also debated whether brown dwarfs would be better defined by 
        their formation processes rather than by their supposed nuclear fusion reactions.

        Stars are categorized by spectral class, with brown dwarfs designated as 
        types M, L, T, and Y.45  Despite their name, brown dwarfs are of different colors.
         Many brown dwarfs would likely appear magenta to the human eye, or possibly 
         orange/red. Brown dwarfs are not very luminous at visible wavelengths.

        There are planets known to orbit brown dwarfs: 2M1207b, MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, and 2MASS J044144b.',

        'Carbon detonation' => 'Carbon detonation or Carbon deflagration is the violent 
        reignition of thermonuclear fusion in a white dwarf star that was previously slowly 
        cooling. It involves a runaway thermonuclear process which spreads through the 
        white dwarf in a matter of seconds, producing a Type Ia supernova which releases an 
        immense amount of energy as the star is blown apart. The carbon detonation/deflagration 
        process leads to a supernova by a different route from the better known Type II core-collapse 
        supernova the type II is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a 
        massive star as its core implodes.

        A white dwarf is the remnant of a small to medium size star, our sun is an example of these. 
        At the end of its life, the star has burned its hydrogen and helium fuel, and thermonuclear 
        fusion processes cease. The star does not have enough mass to either burn much heavier 
        elements, or to implode into a neutron star or type II supernova as a larger star can, 
        from the force of its own gravity, so it gradually shrinks and becomes very dense as it 
        cools, glowing white and then red, for a period many times longer than the present 
        age of the Universe.

        Occasionally though, a white dwarf gains mass from another source – 
        for example a binary star companion that is close enough for the dwarf star to siphon 
        sufficient amounts of matter onto itself or a collision with other stars, the siphoned 
        matter having been expelled during the process of the companion\'s own late stage 
        stellar evolution. If the white dwarf gains enough matter, its internal pressure 
        and temperature will rise enough for carbon to begin fusing in its core. 
        Carbon detonation generally occurs at the point when the accreted matter pushes the 
        white dwarfs mass close to the Chandrasekhar limit of roughly 1.4 solar masses. This 
        is the mass at which gravity can overcome the electron degeneracy pressure which had 
        prevented the star from collapsing during its lifetime. The same also happens when 
        two white dwarfs merge and the mass of the body formed is below the Chandrasekhar l
        imit; if two white dwarves merge and the result is over the limit, a Type 1a supernova will occur.',

        'Carbon star' => 'A carbon star is typically an asymptotic giant branch star, a 
        luminous red giant, whose atmosphere contains more carbon than oxygen; the two 
        elements combine in the upper layers of the star, forming carbon monoxide,
         which consumes all the oxygen in the atmosphere, leaving carbon atoms free 
         to form other carbon compounds, giving the star a sooty atmosphere and a 
         strikingly ruby red appearance. There are also some dwarf and supergiant carbon stars, 
         with the more common giant stars sometimes being called classical carbon stars to distinguish them.

        In most stars, such as the Sun, the atmosphere is richer in oxygen than carbon. 
        Ordinary stars not exhibiting the characteristics of carbon stars but cool enough 
        to form carbon monoxide are therefore called oxygen-rich stars.

        Carbon stars have quite distinctive spectral characteristics, and they were first 
        recognized by their spectra by Angelo Secchi in the 1860s, a pioneering time in astronomical spectroscopy.',

        'CEMP star' => 'Carbon enhanced metal poor stars, usually referred to as CEMP stars, are a 
        class of chemically peculiar star. CEMP stars have C/Fe > +1, which means 
        compared to the Sun these stars have carbon enhanced at least ten times more than iron, 
        and Fe/H < -1, meaning that iron is less than a tenth that in the Sun.

        These are further categorized by whether r-process or s-process elements are enhanced. 
        CEMP-no stars have no enhancement. Some of these are the earliest formed in the Milky Way. 
        The others are termed CEMP-r, CEMP-s, or CEMP-r/s.  Metal poor stars are more likely to 
        be CEMP stars, and once Fe/H < -5.0, then all the stars are CEMP stars.',

        'CH star' => 'CH stars are particular type of carbon stars which are characterized 
        by the presence of exceedingly strong absorption bands due to CH methylidyn) 
        in their spectra. They belong to the stellar population II, meaning they are 
        metal poor and generally pretty middle-aged stars, and are under-luminous 
        compared to the classical C–N carbon stars. The term CH star was coined 
        by Philip C. Keenan in 1942 as a sub-type of the C classification, 
        which he used for carbon stars. The main molecular feature used in 
        identifying the initial set of five CH stars lies in the Fraunhaufer G band.

        In 1975, Yasuho Yamashita noted that some higher temperature carbon stars 
        displayed the typical spectral characteristics of a CH star, but did not 
        have the same kinematic properties. That is, they did not have the higher 
        space velocities characteristic of the older stellar population. These 
        were dubbed CH-like stars. Many CH stars are known to be members of 
        binary star systems, and it is reasonable to believe this is or was the 
        case for all CH stars. Like Barium stars, they are probably the result 
        of a mass transfer from a former classical carbon star companion, now 
        a degenerate white dwarf, to the current CH-classed star.',

        'Circumpolar star' => 'A circumpolar star is a star, as viewed from a 
        given latitude on Earth, that never sets below the horizon due to its 
        apparent proximity to one of the celestial poles. Circumpolar stars are 
        therefore visible from said location toward the nearest pole for the 
        entire night on every night of the year and would be continuously visible 
        throughout the day too, were they not overwhelmed by the Suns glare.

        All circumpolar stars lie within a relative circumpolar circle, whose 
        radius equals the observers latitude. This was in fact the original 
        meaning of Arctic Circle, before the current geographical meaning, 
        meaning Circle of the Bears, Ursa Major, the Great Bear; and Ursa 
        Minor, the Little Bear, from Greek αρκτικός arktikos, near the Bear, 
        from the word άρκτος arktos bear.',

        'Class II star' => 'The luminosity class II in the Yerkes spectral classification 
        is given to bright giants. These are stars which straddle the boundary between 
        ordinary giants and supergiants, based on the appearance of their spectra.',

        'Class K star' => 'A K-type main-sequence star K V, also referred to as an 
        orange dwarf or K dwarf, is a main-sequence hydrogen-burning star of spectral 
        type K and luminosity class V. These stars are intermediate in size between red 
        M-type main-sequence stars red dwarfs and yellow G-type main-sequence stars. 
        They have masses between 0.45 and 0.8 times the mass of the Sun and surface 
        temperatures between 3,900 and 5,200 K., Tables VII, VIII. Better known 
        examples include Alpha Centauri B K1 V and Epsilon Indi.

        These stars are of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life because 
        they are stable on the main sequence for a very long time 15 to 30 billion years, 
        compared to 10 billion for the Sun. Like M-type stars, they tend to have a 
        very small mass, leading to their extremely long lifespan that offers plenty 
        of time for life to develop on orbiting Earth-like, terrestrial planets. 
        In addition, K-type stars emit less ultraviolet radiation which can damage 
        DNA and thus hamper the emergence of nucleic acid based life than G-type 
        stars like the Sun. K-type main-sequence stars are also about three to 
        four times as abundant as G-type main-sequence stars, making planet searches easier.
        While M-type stars are also very abundant, they are more likely to have tidally 
        locked planets in orbit and are more prone to produce solar flares that would more 
        easily strike nearby rocky planets, making it much harder for life to develop. 
        Due to their greater heat, the habitable zones of K-type stars are also much 
        wider than those of M-type stars. For all of these reasons, they may be the most 
        favorable stars to focus on in the search for exoplanets and extraterrestrial life 
        in the universe, especially if they are cooler K6V–K9V, specifically those of the 
        stellar class K7.5V temperate.',

        'Class W' => 'Wolf–Rayet stars, often abbreviated as WR stars, are a rare heterogeneous 
        set of stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad emission lines of 
        highly ionised helium and nitrogen or carbon. The spectra indicate very high 
        surface enhancement of heavy elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar 
        winds. Their surface temperatures range from 30,000 K to around 200,000 K, 
        hotter than almost all other stars.

        Classic or Population I Wolf–Rayet stars are evolved, massive stars that have 
        completely lost their outer hydrogen and are fusing helium or heavier elements 
        in the core. A subset of the population I WR stars show hydrogen lines in their 
        spectra and are known as WNh stars; they are young extremely massive stars still 
        fusing hydrogen at the core, with helium and nitrogen exposed at the surface by 
        strong mixing and radiation-driven mass loss. A separate group of stars with WR 
        spectra are the central stars of planetary nebulae CSPNe, post asymptotic giant 
        branch stars that were similar to the Sun while on the main sequence, but have 
        now ceased fusion and shed their atmospheres to reveal a bare carbon-oxygen core.

        All Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects due to their high temperatures—thousands 
        of times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun L☉ for the CSPNe, hundreds of thousands 
        L☉ for the Population I WR stars, to over a million L☉ for the WNh stars—although 
        not exceptionally bright visually since most of their radiation output is in the ultraviolet.

        The naked-eye stars Gamma Velorum and Theta Muscae, as well as the most massive known star, 
        R136a1 in 30 Doradus, are all Wolf–Rayet stars.',

        is a simple molecule of one carbon atom and one nitrogen atom, with absorption bands 
        around 388.9 and 421.6 nm. This group of stars was first noticed by Nancy G. 
        Roman who called them 4150 stars.',

        'Compact star' => 'In astronomy, the term compact star or compact object refers 
        collectively to white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. It would grow to 
        include exotic stars if such hypothetical dense bodies are confirmed.

        Most compact stars are the endpoints of stellar evolution, and thus often 
        referred to as stellar remnants, the form of the remnant depending primarily 
        on the mass of the star when it formed. All of these objects have a high mass 
        relative to their radius, giving them a very high density. The term compact star 
        is often used when the exact nature of the star is not known, but evidence 
        suggests that it is very massive and has a small radius, thus implying one 
        of the above-mentioned categories. A compact star that is not a black 
        hole may be called a degenerate star.',

        'Dark-energy star' => 'A dark-energy star is a hypothetical compact 
        astrophysical object, which a minority of physicists think might constitute 
        an alternative explanation for observations of astronomical black hole candidates.

        The concept was proposed by physicist George Chapline. The theory states 
        that infalling matter is converted into vacuum energy or dark energy, as the 
        matter falls through the event horizon. The space within the event horizon 
        would end up with a large value for the cosmological constant and have 
        negative pressure to exert against gravity. There would be no 
        information-destroying singularity.',

        'Dark star dark matter' => 'A dark star is a type of star that may have 
        existed early in the universe before conventional stars were able to form. 
        The stars would be composed mostly of normal matter, like modern stars, 
        but a high concentration of neutralino dark matter within them would 
        generate heat via annihilation reactions between the dark-matter particles. 
        This heat would prevent such stars from collapsing into the relatively 
        compact sizes of modern stars and therefore prevent nuclear fusion among 
        the normal matter atoms from being initiated.

        Under this model, a dark star is predicted to be an enormous cloud of hydrogen 
        and helium ranging between 4 and 2000 astronomical units in diameter and with 
        a surface temperature low enough that the emitted radiation would be 
        invisible to the naked eye.

        In the unlikely event that dark stars have endured to the modern era, they 
        could be detectable by their emissions of gamma rays, neutrinos, and antimatter 
        and would be associated with clouds of cold molecular hydrogen gas that 
        normally would not harbor such energetic particles.',

        'Dark star Newtonian mechanics' => 'A dark star is a theoretical object compatible 
        with Newtonian mechanics that, due to its large mass, has a surface escape 
        velocity that equals or exceeds the speed of light. Whether light is affected 
        by gravity under Newtonian mechanics is unclear but if it were accelerated 
        the same way as projectiles, any light emitted at the surface of a dark star 
        would be trapped by the stars gravity, rendering it dark, hence the name. 
        Dark stars are analogous to black holes in general relativity.',

        'Double star' => 'In observational astronomy, a double star or visual double 
        is a pair of stars that appear close to each other in the sky as seen from 
        Earth when viewed through an optical telescope.

        This can happen either because the pair forms a binary star, i.e. a binary system 
        of stars in mutual orbit, gravitationally bound to each other, or because it is an 
        optical double, a chance line-of-sight-alignment of two stars in the sky that lie 
        at different distances. Binary stars are important to stellar astronomers as knowledge 
        of their motions allows direct calculation of stellar mass and other stellar parameters.

        Since the beginning of the 1780s, both professional and amateur double star observers 
        have telescopically measured the distances and angles between double stars 
        to determine the relative motions of the pairs. If the relative motion of 
        a pair determines a curved arc of an orbit, or if the relative motion is 
        small compared to the common proper motion of both stars, it may be concluded 
        that the pair is in mutual orbit as a binary star. Otherwise, the pair is optical. 
        Multiple stars are also studied in this way, although the dynamics of 
        multiple stellar systems are more complex than those of binary stars.

        There are three types of paired stars:

        Optical Doubles are unrelated stars that appear close together through chance alignment with Earth.
        Visual Binaries are gravitationally-bound stars that are separately visible with a telescope.
        Non-Visual Binaries are stars whose binary status was deduced through more esoteric means, such as 
        occultation eclipsing binaries, spectroscopy spectroscopic binaries, or anomalies in proper 
        motion astrometric binaries.
        Improvements in telescopes can shift previously non-visual binaries into visual binaries, 
        as happened with Polaris A in 2006. It is only the inability to telescopically 
        observe two separate stars that distinguish non-visual and visual binaries.',

        'Dwarf star' => 'A dwarf star is a star of relatively small size and low luminosity. 
        Most main sequence stars are dwarf stars. The term was originally coined in 1906 
        when the Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung noticed that the reddest stars—classified 
        as K and M in the Harvard scheme could be divided into two distinct groups. 
        They are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these 
        groups, he called them giant and dwarf stars, the dwarf stars being fainter 
        and the giants being brighter than the Sun. Most stars are currently classified 
        under the Morgan Keenan System using the letters O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, a 
        sequence from the hottest: O type, to the coolest: M type. The scope of the 
        term dwarf was later expanded to include the following:

        Dwarf star alone generally refers to any main-sequence star, a star of luminosity 
        class V: main-sequence stars dwarfs. Example: Achernar B6Vep
        Red dwarfs are low-mass main-sequence stars.
        Yellow dwarfs are main-sequence dwarf stars with masses comparable to that of the Sun.
        Orange dwarfs are K-type main-sequence stars.
        A blue dwarf is a hypothesized class of very-low-mass stars that increase in temperature 
        as they near the end of their main-sequence lifetime.
        A white dwarf is a star composed of electron-degenerate matter, thought to be the final 
        stage in the evolution of stars not massive enough to collapse into a neutron star or 
        black hole—stars less massive than roughly 9 solar masses.
        A black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled sufficiently such that it no longer emits any visible light.
        A brown dwarf is a substellar object not massive enough to ever fuse hydrogen into helium, 
        but still massive enough to fuse deuterium—less than about 0.08 solar masses 
        and more than about 13 Jupiter masses.',

        'Electroweak star' => 'An electroweak star is a theoretical type of exotic star, 
        whereby the gravitational collapse of the star is prevented by radiation pressure 
        resulting from electroweak burning, that is, the energy released by conversion of 
        quarks to leptons through the electroweak force. This process occurs in a volume 
        at the stars core approximately the size of an apple, containing about two Earth masses.

        The stage of life of a star that produces an electroweak star is theorized to occur 
        after a supernova collapse. Electroweak stars are denser than quark stars, and may 
        form when quark degeneracy pressure is no longer able to withstand gravitational 
        attraction, but may still be withstood by electroweak burning radiation pressure. 
        This phase of a stars life may last upwards of 10 million years.',

        'Exotic star' => 'An exotic star is a hypothetical compact star composed of 
        something other than electrons, protons, neutrons, or muons, and balanced against 
        gravitational collapse by degeneracy pressure or other quantum properties. 
        Exotic stars include quark stars composed of quarks and perhaps strange stars
        based upon strange quark matter, a condensate of up, down and strange quarks, 
        as well as speculative preon stars composed of preons, which are hypothetical 
        particles and "building blocks" of quarks, if quarks prove to be decomposable 
        into component sub-particles. Of the various types of exotic star proposed, 
        the most well evidenced and understood is the quark star.

        Exotic stars are largely theoretical – partly because it is difficult to test in 
        detail how such forms of matter may behave, and partly because prior to the fledgling 
        technology of gravitational-wave astronomy, we lacked a satisfactory means of 
        detecting cosmic objects that do not radiate electromagnetically or through 
        known particles. So it is not yet possible to verify novel cosmic objects 
        of this nature by distinguishing them from known objects. Candidates for such 
        objects are occasionally identified based on indirect evidence gained from 
        properties we can observe.',

        'Extreme helium star' => 'An extreme helium star abbreviated EHe is a low-mass 
        supergiant that is almost devoid of hydrogen, the most common chemical element 
        of the Universe. Since there are no conditions where stars devoid of hydrogen 
        can be formed from molecular clouds, it is theorized that they are the product 
        of the mergers of helium-core and carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs.',

        'F-type main-sequence star' => 'An F-type main-sequence star F V is a main-sequence, 
        hydrogen-fusing star of spectral type F and luminosity class V. These stars 
        have from 1.0 to 1.4 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between 
        6,000 and 7,600 K. Tables VII and VIII. This temperature range gives the F-type 
        stars a yellow-white hue. Because a main-sequence star is referred to as a 
        dwarf star, this class of star may also be termed a yellow-white dwarf. Famous 
        examples include Procyon A, Gamma Virginis A and B, and KIC 8462852.',

        'Flare star' => 'A flare star is a variable star that can undergo unpredictable 
        dramatic increases in brightness for a few minutes. It is believed that the flares 
        on flare stars are analogous to solar flares in that they are due to the magnetic 
        energy stored in the stars atmospheres. The brightness increase is across the 
        spectrum, from X rays to radio waves. The first known flare stars V1396 Cygni and AT Microscopii 
        were discovered in 1924. However, the best-known flare star is UV Ceti, 
        discovered in 1948. Today similar flare stars are classified as UV Ceti type 
        variable stars using the abbreviation UV in variable star catalogs such as the 
        General Catalogue of Variable Stars.

        Most flare stars are dim red dwarfs, although recent research indicates that 
        less massive brown dwarfs might also be capable of flaring.
         
        The more massive RS Canum Venaticorum variables RS CVn are also known to flare, 
        but it is understood that these flares are induced by a companion star in a 
        binary system which causes the magnetic field to become tangled. Additionally, 
        nine stars similar to the Sun had also been seen to undergo flare events prior to 
        the flood of superflare data from the Kepler observatory. It has been proposed 
        that the mechanism for this is similar to that of the RS CVn variables in that 
        the flares are being induced by a companion, namely an unseen Jupiter-like planet in a close orbit.',

        'Frozen star - hypothetical star' => 'In astronomy, a frozen star, besides a disused 
        term for a black hole, is a type of hypothetical star that, according to the

        the Universe when the metallicity of the interstellar medium is several times the solar value.',

        'FU Orionis star' => 'In stellar evolution, an FU Orionis star also FU Orionis object, 
        or FUor is a pre–main-sequence star which displays an extreme change in magnitude and 
        spectral type. One example is the star V1057 Cyg, which became 6 magnitudes brighter 
        and went from spectral type dKe to F-type supergiant. These stars are named after their type-star, FU Orionis.',

        'Fusor (astronomy)' => 'A fusor, according to a proposal to the IAU by Gibor Basri, Professor of 
        Astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley to help clarify the nomenclature of c
        elestial bodies, is an object that achieves core fusion during its lifetime. This definition 
        included any form of nuclear fusion, so the lowest possible mass of a fusor was set 
        at roughly 13 times that of Jupiter, at which point deuterium fusion becomes possible. 
        This is significantly smaller than the point at which sustained hydrogen fusion becomes possible, 
        around 60 times the mass of Jupiter. Objects are considered stellar when they are about 75 
        times the mass of Jupiter, when gravitational contraction, i.e. contraction of the object 
        due to gravity, is halted by heat generated by the nuclear reaction in their interiors. 
        Fusors would include active stars, dead stars, and brown dwarfs.

        The introduction of the term fusor would allow for a simple definition:

        Fusor – An object capable of core fusion
        Planemo – A round nonfusor
        Planet – A planemo that orbits a fusor
        where round is understood as whose surface is very nearly on the gravitational equipotential, 
        orbits means whose primary orbit is now, or was in the past around, and capable 
        implies fusion is possible sometime during the existence of the object by itself.',

        'G-type main-sequence star' => 'A G-type main-sequence star Spectral type: G-V, often 
        and imprecisely called a yellow dwarf, or G dwarf star, is a main-sequence star 
        luminosity class V of spectral type G. Such a star has about 0.84 to 1.15 solar 
        masses and surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K., Tables VII, VIII. 
        Like other main-sequence stars, a G-type main-sequence star is converting the 
        element hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion. The Sun, the 
        star to which the Earth is gravitationally bound in the Solar System and the 
        object with the largest apparent magnitude, is an example of a G-type 
        main-sequence star G2V type. Each second, the Sun fuses approximately 600 
        million tons of hydrogen to helium, converting about 4 million tons of 
        matter to energy. Besides the Sun, other well-known examples of G-type 
        main-sequence stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.

        The term yellow dwarf is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in 
        color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly 
        yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. The Sun 
        is in fact white, and its spectrum peaks in blue and green light, but it 
        can often appear yellow, orange or red through Earth\'s atmosphere due to 
        atmospheric Rayleigh scattering, especially at sunrise and sunset. In addition, 
        although the term "dwarf" is used to contrast yellow main-sequence stars from 
        giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun outshine 90% of the stars in the 
        Milky Way which are largely much dimmer orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, 
        nd white dwarfs, the last being a stellar remnant.

        A G-type main-sequence star will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years, 
        until it is exhausted at the center of the star. When this happens, 
        the star expands to many times its previous size and becomes a red giant, 
        such as Aldebaran or Alpha Tauri. Eventually the red giant sheds its outer 
        layers of gas, which become a planetary nebula, while the core rapidly cools 
        and contracts into a compact, dense white dwarf',

        'Gamma-ray burst progenitors' => 'Gamma-ray burst progenitors are the types 
        of celestial objects that can emit gamma-ray bursts GRBs. GRBs show an 
        extraordinary degree of diversity. They can last anywhere from a fraction of 
        a second to many minutes. Bursts could have a single profile or oscillate 
        wildly up and down in intensity, and their spectra are highly variable unlike 
        other objects in space. The near complete lack of observational constraint 
        led to a profusion of theories, including evaporating black holes, magnetic 
        flares on white dwarfs, accretion of matter onto neutron stars, antimatter 
        accretion, supernovae, hypernovae, and rapid extraction of rotational 
        energy from supermassive black holes, among others.

        There are at least two different types of progenitors sources of GRBs: 
        one responsible for the long-duration, soft-spectrum bursts and one 
        or possibly more responsible for short-duration, hard-spectrum bursts. 
        The progenitors of long GRBs are believed to be massive, 
        low-metallicity stars exploding due to the collapse of their cores. T
        he progenitors of short GRBs are thought to arise from mergers of 
        compact binary systems like neutron stars, which was confirmed by 
        the GW170817 observation of a neutron star merger and a kilonova.',

        'Giant star' => 'A giant star is a star with substantially larger radius 
        and luminosity than a main-sequence or dwarf star of the same surface 
        temperature. They lie above the main sequence luminosity class V in 
        the Yerkes spectral classification on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram 
        and correspond to luminosity classes II and III. The terms giant and 
        dwarf were coined for stars of quite different luminosity despite 
        similar temperature or spectral type by Ejnar Hertzsprung about 1905.

        Giant stars have radii up to a few hundred times the Sun and luminosities 
        between 10 and a few thousand times that of the Sun. Stars still more luminous 
        than giants are referred to as supergiants and hypergiants.

        A hot, luminous main-sequence star may also be referred to as a giant,

        alternative to the black hole theory by Pawel O. Mazur and Emil Mottola. 
        It results from assuming physical limitations on the formation of black 
        holes. These limits, such as discrete length and time quanta chronon, 
        are an attempt to modernize the theory by incorporating quantum 
        mechanics. The term gravastar is a portmanteau of the words

        which has extraordinarily strong helium lines and weaker than normal hydrogen 
        lines, indicating strong stellar winds and a mass loss of the outer envelope. 
        Extreme helium stars EHe entirely lack hydrogen in their spectra.

        Previously, a helium star was a synonym for a B class star, but this usage is considered obsolete.

        A helium star is also a term for a hypothetical star that could occur if 
        two helium white dwarfs with a combined mass of at least 0.5 solar 
        masses merge and subsequently start nuclear fusion of helium, 
        with a lifetime of a few hundred million years. This may only happen 
        if these 2 binary masses share the same type of envelope phase. It is 
        believed this is the origin of the extreme helium stars.

        The helium stars great capability of transforming into other stellar objects 
        has been observed over the years. In 2014, a helium nova named V445 Puppis 
        exploded, along with a following explosion of the star SN2012Z, causing 
        a high-mass transfer between the two. It is observed to have caused a

        'Herbig Ae/Be star' => 'A Herbig Ae/Be star HAeBe is a pre-main-sequence 
        star – a young <10Myr star of spectral types A or B. These stars are still

        circumstellar disks. Hydrogen and calcium emission lines are observed in 
        their spectra. They are 2-8 Solar mass M☉ objects, still existing in the 
        star formation gravitational contraction stage and approaching the main 
        sequence i.e. they are not burning hydrogen in their center. In the 
        Hertzsprung–Russell diagram these stars are located to the right of the 
        main sequence. They are named after the American astronomer George Herbig, w
        ho first distinguished them from other stars in 1960. The original Herbig criteria were:

        Spectral type earlier than F0 in order to exclude T Tauri stars,
        Balmer emission lines in the stellar spectrum in order to be similar to T Tauri stars,
        Projected location within the boundaries of a dark interstellar cloud in order to 
        select really young stars near their birthplaces,
        Illumination of a nearby bright reflection nebula in order to guarantee 
        physical link with star formation region.
        There are now several known isolated Herbig Ae/Be stars i.e. not 
        connected with dark clouds or nebulae). Thus the most reliable criteria now can be:

        Spectral type earlier than F0,
        Balmer emission lines in the stellar spectrum,
        Infrared radiation excess in comparison with normal stars due to 
        circumstellar dust in order to distinguish from classical Be stars,

        A hydrogen-deficient star is a type of star that has little or no hydrogen in 
        its atmosphere.  Hydrogen deficiency is unusual in a star, as hydrogen is typically the 
        most common element in a stellar atmosphere. Despite being rare, there are a variety of

        system. However, this is rarely seen in the literature or in published spectral 
        classifications, except for specific well-defined groups such as the yellow 
        hypergiants, RSG red supergiants, or blue B e supergiants with emission spectra. 
        More commonly, hypergiants may be classed as Ia-0 or Ia+, but red supergiants 
        are rarely assigned these spectral classifications. Astronomers are mostly

        intergalactic stars are now generally thought to have originated in galaxies 
        like other stars, but later expelled as the result of either colliding galaxies 
        or of a multiple star system travelling too close to a supermassive black hole, 
        which are found at the center of many galaxies.

        'Iron star' => 'In astronomy, an iron star is a hypothetical type of compact star 
        that could occur in the universe in the extremely far future, after perhaps 101500 years.

        The premise behind iron stars states that cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling 
        would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into iron-56 nuclei. 
        Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, 
        converting stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of iron. The formation of these 
        stars is only a possibility if protons do not decay. Though the surface of a neutron 
        star may be iron, according to some predictions, it is distinct from an iron star.

        Unrelatedly, the term is also used for blue supergiants which have a forest of forbidden FeII 
        lines in their spectra. They are potentially quiescent hot luminous blue variables. Eta 
        Carinae has been described as a prototypical example.',

        'K-type main-sequence star' => 'A K-type main-sequence star K V, also referred to as an orange

        luminosity class V. These stars are intermediate in size between red M-type 
        main-sequence stars red dwarfs and yellow G-type main-sequence stars. 
        They have masses between 0.45 and 0.8 times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures 
        between 3,900 and 5,200 K., Tables VII, VIII. Better known examples include 
        Alpha Centauri B K1 V and Epsilon Indi.

        These stars are of particular interest in the search for extraterrestrial life because 
        they are stable on the main sequence for a very long time, 15 to 30 billion years, 
        compared to 10 billion for the Sun. Like M-type stars, they tend to have a very small 
        mass, leading to their extremely long lifespan that offers plenty of time for 
        life to develop on orbiting Earth-like, terrestrial planets. In addition, 
        K-type stars emit less ultraviolet radiation which can damage DNA and thus 
        hamper the emergence of nucleic acid based life than G-type stars like the Sun.
        K-type main-sequence stars are also about three to four times as abundant as 
        G-type main-sequence stars, making planet searches easier. While M-type stars 
        are also very abundant, they are more likely to have tidally locked planets in 
        orbit and are more prone to produce solar flares that would more easily strike 
        nearby rocky planets, making it much harder for life to develop. Due to their 
        greater heat, the habitable zones of K-type stars are also much wider than 
        those of M-type stars. For all of these reasons, they may be the most favorable stars 
        to focus on in the search for exoplanets and extraterrestrial life in the universe,

        'Kilonova' => 'A kilonova macronova or r-process supernova is a transient 
        astronomical event that occurs in a compact binary system when two neutron 
        stars or a neutron star and a black hole merge into each other. Kilonovae 
        are thought to emit short gamma-ray bursts and strong electromagnetic radiation 
        due to the radioactive decay of heavy r-process nuclei that are produced and 
        ejected fairly isotropically during the merger process.

        The term kilonova was introduced by Metzger et al. in 2010 to characterize 
        the peak brightness, which they showed reaches 1000 times that of a classical 
        nova. They are 1/10th to 1/100th the brightness of a typical supernova,

        were initially described as periodic Be stars. Lambda Eridani is an example 
        and the prototype. This has been ascribed to non-radial pulsations, inhomogeneous 
        rotating discs, or the rotation of the star itself.

        These stars are rarely classified, or are classified incorrectly. The General 
        Catalogue of Variable Stars does not have a type for λ Eridani variables, only 
        GCAS for Gamma Cassiopeiae variables and BE for non-GCAS Be star variables. λ

        'Main sequence' => 'In astronomy, the main sequence is a continuous and distinctive 
        band of stars that appear on plots of stellar color versus brightness. These color-magnitude 
        plots are known as Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams after their co-developers, 
        Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Stars on this band are known as 
        main-sequence stars or dwarf stars. These are the most numerous true stars in the 
        universe, and include the Earths Sun.

        After condensation of mass and ignition of a star, it generates thermal energy in the 
        dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. During this 
        stage of the stars lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined 
        primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. 
        All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal 
        pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational 
        collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy 
        generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. 
        Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated 
        away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, 
        with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.

        The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on 
        the dominant process that a star uses to generate energy. Stars below about 
        1.5 times the mass of the Sun 1.5 M☉ primarily fuse hydrogen atoms together 
        in a series of stages to form helium, a sequence called the proton–proton chain. 
        Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process mainly 
        uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the CNO cycle 
        that produces helium from hydrogen atoms. Main-sequence stars with more than 
        two solar masses undergo convection in their core regions, which acts to 
        stir up the newly created helium and maintain the proportion of fuel needed 
        for fusion to occur. Below this mass, stars have cores that are entirely 
        radiative with convective zones near the surface. With decreasing stellar 
        mass, the proportion of the star forming a convective envelope steadily increases. 
        Main-sequence stars below 0.4 M☉ undergo convection throughout their mass. 
        When core convection does not occur, a helium-rich core develops surrounded 
        by an outer layer of hydrogen.

        In general, the more massive a star is, the shorter its lifespan on the 
        main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, 
        the star evolves away from the main sequence on the HR diagram. The 
        behavior of a star now depends on its mass, with stars below 0.23 M☉ 
        becoming white dwarfs directly, whereas stars with up to ten solar 
        masses pass through a red giant stage. More massive stars can explode 
        as a supernova, or collapse directly into a black hole.

        In April, 2018, astronomers reported the detection of the most distant ordinary 
        i.e., main sequence star, named Icarus formally, MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1, at 9 billion light-years away from Earth.',


        'Mercury-manganese star' => 'A mercury-manganese star is a type of chemically peculiar 
        star with a prominent spectral line at 398.4 nm, due to absorption from ionized mercury. 
        These stars are of spectral type B8, B9, or A0, corresponding to surface temperatures 
        between about 10,000 and 15,000 K, with two distinctive characteristics:

        An atmospheric excess of elements like phosphorus, manganese, gallium, strontium, 
        yttrium, zirconium, platinum and mercury.
        A lack of a strong dipole magnetic field.
        Their rotation is relatively slow, and as a consequence their atmosphere is relatively calm. 
        It is thought, but has not been proven, that some types of atoms sink under 
        the force of gravity, while others are lifted towards the exterior of the s
        tar by radiation pressure, making a heterogeneous atmosphere.',

        'Neutron star' => 'A neutron star is the collapsed core of a large star which 
        before collapse had a total of between 10 and 29 solar masses. Neutron stars are 
        the smallest and densest stars, not counting hypothetical quark stars and strange stars. 
        Typically, neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres 6.2 mi and 
        a mass between 1.4 and 2.16 solar masses. They result from the supernova explosion 
        of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past 
        the white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei. Once formed, they no longer actively 
        generate heat, and cool over time; however, they may still evolve further through collision 
        or accretion. Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are 
        composed almost entirely of neutrons subatomic particles with no net electrical 
        charge and with slightly larger mass than protons); the electrons and protons present 
        in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions in a neutron star. 
        Neutron stars are supported against further collapse by neutron degeneracy 
        pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle, just as white 
        dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure. 
        If the remnant star has a mass greater than about 3 solar masses, it continues 
        collapsing to form a black hole.

        Neutron stars that can be observed are very hot and typically have a surface temperature of 
        around 600000 K. They are so dense that a normal-sized matchbox containing neutron-star 
        material would have a mass of approximately 3 billion tonnes, or a 0.5 cubic kilometre 
        chunk of the Earth a cube with edges of about 800 metres. Their magnetic fields are 
        between 108 and 1015 100 million to 1 quadrillion times as strong as that of the Earth. 
        The gravitational field at the neutron stars surface is about 2×1011 200 billion times 
        that of the Earth.

        As the stars core collapses, its rotation rate increases as a result of conservation of 
        angular momentum, hence newly formed neutron stars rotate at up to several hundred times 
        per second. Some neutron stars emit beams of electromagnetic radiation that make them 
        detectable as pulsars. Indeed, the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 
        1967 was the first observational suggestion that neutron stars exist. The radiation 
        from pulsars is thought to be primarily emitted from regions near their magnetic poles. 
        If the magnetic poles do not coincide with the rotational axis of the neutron star, 
        the emission beam will sweep the sky, and when seen from a distance, if the observer 
        is somewhere in the path of the beam, it will appear as pulses of radiation coming 
        from a fixed point in space the so-called lighthouse effect. The fastest-spinning 
        neutron star known is PSR J1748-2446ad, rotating at a rate of 716 times a second 
        or 43,000 revolutions per minute, giving a linear speed at the surface on the 
        order of 0.24 c i.e. nearly a quarter the speed of light.

        There are thought to be around 100 million neutron stars in the Milky Way, a figure 
        obtained by estimating the number of stars that have undergone supernova explosions.
        However, most are old and cold, and neutron stars can only be easily detected in 
        certain instances, such as if they are a pulsar or part of a binary system. 
        Slow-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are almost undetectable; however, 
        since the Hubble Space Telescope detection of RX J185635-3754, a few nearby 
        neutron stars that appear to emit only thermal radiation have been detected. 
        Soft gamma repeaters are conjectured to be a type of neutron star with very 
        strong magnetic fields, known as magnetars, or alternatively, neutron stars 
        with fossil disks around them.

        Neutron stars in binary systems can undergo accretion which typically makes the 
        system bright in X-rays while the material falling onto the neutron star can 
        form hotspots that rotate in and out of view in identified X-ray pulsar systems. 
        Additionally, such accretion can "recycle" old pulsars and potentially cause 
        them to gain mass and spin-up to very fast rotation rates, forming the so-called 
        millisecond pulsars. These binary systems will continue to evolve, and eventually 
        the companions can become compact objects such as white dwarfs or neutron stars 
        themselves, though other possibilities include a complete destruction of the 
        companion through ablation or merger. The merger of binary neutron stars may be 
        the source of short-duration gamma-ray bursts and are likely strong sources of 
        gravitational waves. In 2017, a direct detection GW170817 of the gravitational 
        waves from such an event was made, and gravitational waves have also been 
        indirectly detected in a system where two neutron stars orbit each other.',

        lines, strong lines of other ionised elements, and Hydrogen and neutral He 
        lines weaker than spectral type B.

        Stars of this type are particularly rare; only 0.00003% of the main sequence are 
        O-type stars. However, because they are usually very bright, they can be seen when 
        further away than dimmer stars, and four of the 90 brightest stars as seen from 
        Earth are O type. Due to high temperature and luminosity, O-type stars end their 
        lives rather quickly in violent supernova explosions, resulting in black holes or 
        neutron stars. Most of these stars are young massive main sequence, giant, or 
        supergiant stars, but the central stars of planetary nebulae, old low-mass 
        stars near the end of their lives, also usually have O spectra.

        O-type stars are typically located in regions of active star formation, 
        such as the spiral arms of a spiral galaxy or a pair of galaxies undergoing 
        collision and merger (such as the Antennae Galaxies). These stars illuminate 
        any surrounding material and are largely responsible for the distinct coloration of a 
        galaxys arms. Furthermore, O-type stars are also frequent in multiple star systems where 
        their evolution is more difficult to predict due to mass transfer and the possibility 
        of component stars going supernova at different times.',

        'OB star' => 'OB stars are hot, massive stars of spectral types O or early-type B that 
        form in loosely organized groups called OB associations. They are short lived, and thus 
        do not move very far from where they formed within their life. During their lifetime, 
        they will emit much ultraviolet radiation. This radiation rapidly ionizes the surrounding 
        interstellar gas of the giant molecular cloud, forming an H II region or Strömgren sphere.',

        'Optical pulsar' => 'An optical pulsar is a pulsar which can be detected in the visible spectrum. 
        There are very few of these known: the Crab pulsar was detected by stroboscopic techniques 
        in 1969, shortly after its discovery in radio waves, at the Steward Observatory. The Vela 
        pulsar was detected in 1977 at the Anglo-Australian Observatory, and was the faintest star
         ever imaged at that time.',

        'Chemically peculiar star' => 'In astrophysics, chemically peculiar stars CP stars are stars 
        with distinctly unusual metal abundances, at least in their surface layers.

        Chemically peculiar stars are common among hot main sequence hydrogen-burning stars. 
        These hot peculiar stars have been divided into 4 main classes on the basis of their 
        spectra, although two classification systems are sometimes used:

        non-magnetic metallic-lined Am, CP1
        magnetic Ap, CP2
        non-magnetic mercury-manganese HgMn, CP3
        helium-weak He-weak, CP4.
        The class names provide a good idea of the peculiarities that set them apart from 
        other stars on or near the main sequence. The Am stars CP1 stars show weak lines 
        of singly ionized Ca and/or Sc, but show enhanced abundances of heavy metals. They also 
        tend to be slow rotators and have an effective temperature between 7000 K and 10 000 K. 
        The Ap stars CP2 stars are characterized by strong magnetic fields, enhanced abundances 
        of elements such as Si, Cr, Sr and Eu, and are also generally slow rotators. The effective 
        temperature of these stars is stated to be between 8000 K and 15 000 K, but the 
        issue of calculating effective temperatures in such peculiar stars is complicated 
        by atmospheric structure. The HgMn stars CP3 stars are also classically placed within 
        the Ap category, but they do not show the strong magnetic fields associated with classical 
        Ap stars. As the name implies, these stars show increased abundances of singly ionized 
        Hg and Mn. These stars are also very slow rotators, even by the standards of 
        CP stars. The effective temperature range for these stars is quoted at between 
        10 000 K and 15 000 K. The He-weak stars CP4 stars show weaker He lines than would be 
        expected classically from their observed Johnson UBV colours. A rare class of 
        He-weak stars are, paradoxically, the helium-rich stars, with temperatures of 18,000 - 23,000 K.

        It is generally thought that the peculiar surface compositions observed in these 
        hot main-sequence stars have been caused by processes that happened after the 
        star formed, such as diffusion or magnetic effects in the outer layers of the stars. 
        These processes cause some elements, particularly He, N and O, to settle out in the 
        atmosphere into the layers below, while other elements such as Mn, Sr, Y and Zr are 
        levitated out of the interior to the surface, resulting in the observed spectral 
        peculiarities. It is assumed that the centers of the stars, and the bulk 
        compositions of the entire star, have more normal chemical abundance mixtures 
        which reflect the compositions of the gas clouds from which they formed. 
        In order for such diffusion and levitation to occur and the resulting layers 
        to remain intact, the atmosphere of such a star must be stable enough to 
        convection that convective mixing does not occur. The proposed mechanism causing 
        this stability is the unusually large magnetic field that is generally observed in stars of this type.

        Approximately 5-10% of hot main sequence stars show chemical peculiarities. 
        Of these, the vast majority are Ap or Bp stars with strong magnetic fields. 
        Non-magnetic, or only weakly magnetic, chemically peculiar stars mostly 
        fall into the Am or HgMn categories.

        There are also classes of chemically peculiar cool stars that is, 
        stars with spectral type G or late, but these stars are typically 
        not main-sequence stars. These are usually identified by the name of their 
        class or some further specific label. The phrase chemically peculiar star 
        without further specification usually means a member of one of the hot 
        main sequence types described above. Many of the cooler chemically 
        peculiar stars are the result of the mixing of nuclear fusion products 
        from the interior of the star to its surface; these include most of the 
        carbon stars and S-type stars. Others are the result of mass transfer 
        in a binary star system; examples of these include the barium stars 
        and some S stars.',

        'PG 1159 star' => 'A PG 1159 star, often also called a pre-degenerate, is a 
        star with a hydrogen-deficient atmosphere that is in transition between 
        being the central star of a planetary nebula and being a hot white dwarf. 
        These stars are hot, with surface temperatures between 75,000 K and 200,000 K, 
        and are characterized by atmospheres with little hydrogen and absorption 
        lines for helium, carbon and oxygen. Their surface gravity is typically 
        between 104 and 106 meters per second squared. Some PG 1159 stars are 
        still fusing helium., § 2.1.1, 2.1.2, Table 2. The PG 1159 stars are named 
        after their prototype, PG 1159-035. This star, found in the Palomar-Green
         survey of ultraviolet-excess stellar objects, was the first PG 1159 star discovered.

        It is thought that the atmospheric composition of PG 1159 stars is odd because, 
        after they have left the asymptotic giant branch, they have reignited helium fusion. 
        As a result, a PG 1159 stars atmosphere is a mixture of material which was between 
        the hydrogen- and helium-burning shells of its AGB star progenitor, §1. They are 
        believed to eventually lose mass, cool, and become DO white dwarfs. §4.

        Some PG 1159 stars have varying luminosities. These stars vary slightly 5–10% in 
        brightness due to non-radial gravity wave pulsations within themselves. They 
        vibrate in a number of modes simultaneously, with typical periods between 300 
        and 3,000 seconds.The first known star of this type is also PG 1159-035, 
        which was found to be variable in 1979, and was given the variable star 
        designation GW Vir in 1985. These stars are called GW Vir stars, after 
        their prototype, or the class may be split into DOV and PNNV stars',

        'Photometric-standard star' => 'Photometric-standard stars are a series of stars that 
        have had their light output in various passbands of photometric system measured 
        very carefully. Other objects can be observed using CCD cameras or photoelectric 
        photometers connected to a telescope, and the flux, or amount of light received, 
        can be compared to a photometric-standard star to determine the exact brightness, 
        or stellar magnitude, of the object.

        A current set of photometric-standard stars for UBVRI photometry is that published 
        by Arlo U. Landolt in 1992 in the Astronomical Journal, vol. 104, no. 1, p. 340-371.',

        'Planck star' => 'A Planck star is a hypothetical astronomical object that is created 
        when the energy density of a collapsing star reaches the Planck energy density. 
        Under these conditions, assuming gravity and spacetime are quantized, there arises 
        a repulsive force derived from Heisenbergs uncertainty principle. Namely, if gravity 
        and spacetime are quantized, the accumulation of mass-energy inside the Planck star 
        cannot collapse beyond this limit because it violates the uncertainty principle for spacetime itself.

        The key feature of this theoretical object is that this repulsion arises from the 
        energy density, not the Planck length, and starts taking effect far earlier than 
        might be expected. This repulsive force is strong enough to stop the collapse 
        of the star well before a singularity is formed, and indeed, well before the 
        Planck scale for distance. Since a Planck star is calculated to be considerably 
        larger than the Planck scale for distance, this means there is adequate room for 
        all the information captured in the black hole to be encoded upon the star, 
        thus avoiding information loss.

        While it would be expected that such a repulsion would act very quickly to reverse 
        the collapse of a star, it turns out that the relativistic effects of the very 
        extreme gravity such an object generates slows down time for the Planck star to 
        a similarly extreme degree. Seen from outside, the rebound from a Planck star of 
        stellar mass takes longer than the timescale of the universe to date, such that 
        stellar mass black holes seem to be stable to an external observer. Even more elegantly, 
        the emission of Hawking radiation can be calculated to correspond handily to the 
        timescale of the gravity effects on time, such that the event horizon that forms a black 
        hole naturally evaporates as the rebound proceeds.

        In 2014 Carlo Rovelli and Francesca Vidotto proposed that there is a Planck star inside a black hole.
        This theory, if correct, would resolve the black hole firewall and black hole information paradox. 
        This idea is based on loop quantum gravity',

        'Pole star' => 'Pole star or polar star refers to a star, preferably bright, closely aligned 
        to the axis of rotation of an astronomical object. This is most commonly used for stars 
        close to the north and south celestial poles of the Earth. The name is frequently applied 
        to Polaris in the constellation Ursa Minor, acknowledging its property extant since the 10th century 
        of being the naked-eye star closest to the Earths north celestial pole. The name Polaris, 
        introduced in the 18th century, is shortened from New Latin stella polaris, meaning pole star. 
        Polaris is also known as Lodestar, Guiding Star, or North Star from its property of 
        remaining in a fixed position throughout the course of the night and its use in 
        celestial navigation. It is a dependable, though inexact, indicator of the direction 
        toward the geographic north pole; it is virtually fixed, and its angle of elevation 
        can also be used to determine latitude. The south celestial pole lacks a bright star 
        like Polaris to mark its position. At present, the naked-eye star nearest to the 
        celestial south pole is the faint Sigma Octantis, sometimes called the South Star.

        The identity of the pole stars gradually changes over time because the celestial poles 
        exhibit a slow continuous drift through the star field. The primary reason for this is 
        the precession of Earths rotational axis, which causes its orientation to change over 
        time. Precession causes the celestial poles to trace out circles on the celestial 
        sphere approximately once every 26,000 years, passing close to different naked-eye 
        stars at different times with an additional slight shift due to the proper motion of the stars.',

        'Population I star' => 'Population I, or metal-rich, stars are young stars with the highest 
        metallicity out of all three populations, and are more commonly found in the spiral arms 
        of the Milky Way galaxy. The Earth\'s Sun is an example of a metal-rich star and is 
        considered as an intermediate Population I star, while the solar-like Mu Arae 
        is much richer in metals.

        Population I stars usually have regular elliptical orbits of the galactic centre, 
        with a low relative velocity. It was earlier hypothesized that the high metallicity 
        of Population I stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than the 
        other two populations, because planets, particularly terrestrial planets, are 
        thought to be formed by the accretion of metals.[11] However, observations of the 
        Kepler data-set have found smaller planets around stars with a range of 
        metallicities, while only larger, potential gas giant planets are concentrated 
        around stars with relatively higher metallicity — a finding that has implications 
        for theories of gas giant formation. Between the intermediate Population I 
        and the Population II stars comes the intermediary disc population.',

        'Population II star' => 'Population II, or metal-poor, stars are those with relatively 
        little metal. The idea of a relatively small amount must be kept in perspective as 
        even metal-rich astronomical objects contain low percentages of any element other 
        than hydrogen or helium; metals constitute only a tiny percentage of the overall 
        chemical makeup of the universe, even 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. 
        However, metal-poor objects are even more ancient. These objects are formed 
        during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate Population I stars are 
        common in the bulge near the centre of our galaxy, whereas Population II stars 
        found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters
         also contain high numbers of population II stars.

        It is thought that population II stars created all the other elements in the 
        periodic table, except the more unstable ones. An interesting characteristic of 
        Population II stars is that despite their lower overall metallicity, 
        they often have a higher ratio of alpha elements O, Si, Ne, etc. 
        relative to Fe as compared to Population I stars; current theory suggests 
        this is the result of Type II supernovae being more important contributors 
        to the interstellar medium at the time of their formation, whereas 
        Type Ia supernovae metal enrichment came later in the universes evolution.

        Scientists have targeted these oldest stars in several different surveys, 
        including the HK objective-prism survey of Timothy C. Beers et al. and the
         Hamburg-ESO survey of Norbert Christlieb et al., originally started for 
         faint quasars. Thus far, they have uncovered and studied in detail about
          ten very metal-poor stars such as Snedens Star, Cayrels Star, BD +17° 3248, 
          and three of the oldest stars known to date: HE0107-5240, HE1327-2326 
          and HE 1523-0901. Caffaus star was identified as the most metal-poor star yet 
          when it was found in 2012 using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. However, i
          n February 2014 the discovery of an even lower metallicity star was announced, 
          SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 located with the aid of SkyMapper astronomical survey data. 
          Less extreme in their metal deficiency, but nearer and brighter and hence longer 
          known, are HD 122563 a red giant and HD 140283 a subgiant.',

        'Population III star' => 'Population III stars` are a hypothetical population 
        of extremely massive and hot stars with virtually no metals, except possibly 
        for intermixing ejecta from other nearby Population III supernovas. Their 
        existence is inferred from physical cosmology, but they have not yet been 
        observed directly. Indirect evidence for their existence has been found in a
         gravitationally lensed galaxy in a very distant part of the universe.
         
         Their existence may account for the fact that heavy elements — which could not 
         have been created in the Big Bang — are observed in quasar emission spectra. 
         They are also thought to be components of faint blue galaxies. These stars likely 
         triggered the universes period of reionization, a major phase transition of gases 
         leading to the opacity observed today. Observations of the galaxy UDFy-38135539 
         suggest it may have played a role in this reionization process. The European Southern 
         Observatory discovered a bright pocket of early population stars in a very bright 
         galaxy Cosmos Redshift 7 from the reionization period around 800 million years 
         after the Big Bang. The rest of the galaxy has some later redder population II stars. 
         Some theories hold that there were two generations of Population III stars.',

        'Preon star' => 'A preon star is a theoretical type of compact star made of preons, 
        which are point-like particles conceived to be subcomponents of quarks and leptons.  
        Their existence was first theorized in 2005 by Fredrik Sandin and Johan Hansson, 
        both from the Luleå University of Technology, Sweden. The theory behind them was 
        that the sub-subatomic particles would have come before subatomic particles, 
        which came before particles, and that the original stars were made of these 
        sub-subatomic particles, with most gradually becoming made of sub-particles, 
        and then particles. However, the theory postulates that it is possible for some 
        stars made of the sub-subatomic particles to remain.[3] It is believed that 
        they may also form out of massive stars that collapse too unstably to become neutron stars,

        phase begins when a molecular cloud first collapses under the force of self-gravity. 
        It ends when the protostar blows back the infalling gas and is revealed as an 
        optically visible pre-main-sequence star, which later contracts to become a main sequence star.',

        'Pulsar' => 'A pulsar from pulse and -ar as in quasar is a highly magnetized 
        rotating neutron star or white dwarf that emits a beam of electromagnetic 
        radiation. This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is 
        pointing toward Earth, much like the way a lighthouse can be seen only 
        when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer, and is responsible 
        for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense, and 
        have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise 
        interval between pulses that range from milliseconds to seconds for 
        an individual pulsar. Pulsars are believed to be one of the candidates 
        of the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

        The precise periods of pulsars make them very useful tools. Observations of 
        a pulsar in a binary neutron star system were used to indirectly confirm the 
        existence of gravitational radiation. The first extrasolar planets were discovered 
        around a pulsar, PSR B1257+12. Certain types of pulsars rival atomic clocks

        into DOV and PNNV stars; they are not, strictly speaking, 
        white dwarfs but pre-white dwarfs which have not yet reached the white dwarf 
        region on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A subtype of DQV stars, with 
        carbon-dominated atmospheres, has also been proposed, and in May 2012, 
        the first extremely low mass variable ELMV white dwarf was reported.

        These variables all exhibit small 1%–30% variations in light output,

        Sometimes K-type main-sequence stars, with masses between 0.50-0.8 solar 
        mass, are also included.

        Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Milky Way, at least in 
        the neighborhood of the Sun, but because of their low luminosity, individual red dwarfs 
        cannot be easily observed. From Earth, not one is visible to the naked eye. 
        Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Sun, is a red dwarf Type M5, 
        apparent magnitude 11.05, as are fifty of the sixty nearest stars. 
        According to some estimates, red dwarfs make up three-quarters of the stars in the Milky Way.

        Stellar models indicate that red dwarfs less than 0.35 M☉ are fully convective. 
        Hence the helium produced by the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen is constantly 
        remixed throughout the star, avoiding helium buildup at the core, thereby prolonging 
        the period of fusion. Red dwarfs therefore develop very slowly, maintaining a constant

         or lower. The appearance of the red giant is from yellow-orange to red, including the 
         spectral types K and M, but also class S stars and most carbon stars.

        The most common red giants are stars on the red-giant branch RGB that are still 
        fusing hydrogen into helium in a shell surrounding an inert helium core. Other 
        red giants are the red-clump stars in the cool half of the horizontal branch, 
        fusing helium into carbon in their cores via the triple-alpha process; and the 
        asymptotic-giant-branch AGB stars with a helium burning shell outside a degenerate 
        carbon–oxygen core, and a hydrogen burning shell just beyond that.',

        intermediate-mass stars. Red-giant-branch stars have an inert helium core surrounded 
        by a shell of hydrogen fusing via the CNO cycle. They are K- and M-class stars much

        stars are one possible source to allow gravitational waves to be studied.

        Another definition of a relativistic star is one with the equation of state of a 
        special relativistic gas. This can happen when the core of a massive main-sequence 
        star becomes hot enough to generate electron-positron pairs. Stability analysis 
        shows that such a star is only marginally bound, and is unstable to either 
        collapse or explode. This instability is believed to limit the mass of 
        main-sequence stars to a couple of hundred solar masses or so. Stars of 
        this size and larger are able to directly collapse into a black hole of 
        either intermediate or supermassive size',

        'S-type star' => 'An S-type star or just S star is a cool giant with approximately 
        equal quantities of carbon and oxygen in its atmosphere. The class was 
        originally defined in 1922 by Paul Merrill for stars with unusual 
        absorption lines and molecular bands now known to be due to s-process elements. 
        The bands of zirconium monoxide ZrO are a defining feature of the S stars.

        The carbon stars have more carbon than oxygen in their atmospheres. 
        In most stars, such as class M giants, the atmosphere is richer in oxygen 
        than carbon and they are referred to as oxygen-rich stars. S-type stars 
        are intermediate between carbon stars and normal giants. They can be 
        grouped into two classes: intrinsic S stars, which owe their spectra to 
        convection of fusion products and s-process elements to the surface; and 
        extrinsic S stars, which are formed through mass transfer in a binary 
        system.

        The intrinsic S-type stars are on the most luminous portion of the asymptotic 
        giant branch, a stage of their lives lasting less than a million years. 
        Many are long period variable stars. The extrinsic S stars are less 
        luminous and longer-lived, often smaller-amplitude semiregular or 
        irregular variables. S stars are relatively rare, with intrinsic 
        S stars forming less than 10% of asymptotic giant branch stars of

        mechanism, but shell stars are still considered enigmatic. Shell stars 
        belong to spectral types O7.5 to F5, but their spectra are characterized 
        by enormously widened absorption lines due to fast rotation and 
        the disc that contributes also to other spectral peculiarities.

        Intrinsic variables, whose luminosity actually changes; for example, 
        because the star periodically swells and shrinks.
        Extrinsic variables, whose apparent changes in brightness are due to 
        changes in the amount of their light that can reach Earth; for example, 
        because the star has an orbiting companion that sometimes eclipses it.',

        'White dwarf' => 'A white dwarf, also called a degenerate dwarf, 
        is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. 
        A white dwarf is very dense: its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, 
        while its volume is comparable to that of Earth. A white dwarfs faint 
        luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes 
        place in a white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known 
        white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the 
        Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs 
        among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun.[2] The unusual faintness of 
        white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was 
        coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.

        White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass 
        is not high enough to become a neutron star, which would include the Sun 
        and over 97% of the other stars in the Milky Way. 1. After the hydrogen-fusing 
        period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, such a star will 
        expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen 
        in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to 
        generate the core temperatures required to fuse carbon around 1 billion K, 
        an inert mass of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such 
        a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, it will leave 
        behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. Usually, white dwarfs are 
        composed of carbon and oxygen. If the mass of the progenitor is between 8 
        and 10.5 solar masses M☉, the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse 
        carbon but not neon, in which case an oxygen–neon–magnesium white dwarf may form. 
        Stars of very low mass will not be able to fuse helium, hence, a helium white dwarf 
        may form by mass loss in binary systems.

        The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no 
        source of energy. As a result, it cannot support itself by the heat generated by 
        fusion against gravitational collapse, but is supported only by electron 
        degeneracy pressure, causing it to be extremely dense. The physics of 
        degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf, 
        the Chandrasekhar limit—approximately 1.44 times of M☉—beyond which it 
        cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. A carbon-oxygen 
        white dwarf that approaches this mass limit, typically by mass transfer 
        from a companion star, may explode as a type Ia supernova via a process 
        known as carbon detonation.  SN 1006 is thought to be a famous example.

        A white dwarf is very hot when it forms, but because it has no source of energy, 
        it will gradually radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, 
        which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. 
        Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to 
        crystallize starting with the core. The stars low temperature means it will 
        no longer emit significant heat or light, and it will become a cold black dwarf. 
        Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state 
        is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe approximately 13.8 billion years,
        it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist.
        
        The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.',

        'Wolf–Rayet star' => 'Wolf–Rayet stars, often abbreviated as WR stars, are a rare 
        heterogeneous set of stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad emission 
        lines of highly ionised helium and nitrogen or carbon. The spectra indicate very 
        high surface enhancement of heavy elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong 
        stellar winds. Their surface temperatures range from 30,000 K to around 200,000 K, 
        hotter than almost all other stars.

        Classic or Population I Wolf–Rayet stars are evolved, massive stars that have 
        completely lost their outer hydrogen and are fusing helium or heavier 
        elements in the core. A subset of the population I WR stars show hydrogen 
        lines in their spectra and are known as WNh stars; they are young extremely 
        massive stars still fusing hydrogen at the core, with helium and nitrogen 
        exposed at the surface by strong mixing and radiation-driven mass loss. 
        A separate group of stars with WR spectra are the central stars of 
        planetary nebulae CSPNe, post asymptotic giant branch stars that were 
        similar to the Sun while on the main sequence, but have now ceased 
        fusion and shed their atmospheres to reveal a bare carbon-oxygen core.

        All Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects due to their high temperatures—thousands 
        of times the bolometric luminosity of the Sun L☉ for the CSPNe, hundreds of thousands L☉ 
        for the Population I WR stars, to over a million L☉ for the WNh stars—although 
        not exceptionally bright visually since most of their radiation output is in the ultraviolet.
