         with a bright center called the nucleus. Our own Milky Way is a spiral galaxy. 
         Spiral galaxies are represented by the letter S and are divided into four subgroups. 
         These are S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc. S0 galaxies have a bright nucleus but have no spiral arms. 
         Sa galaxies have spiral arms that are wound tightly around the nucleus while the arms of 
         Sc galaxies are wound much more loosely.'

            difference. The arms spiral out from a straight bar of stars instead of from the center. 
            About one third of all spiral galaxies are barred spiral in shape. Barred spiral galaxies 
            are represented by the letters SB and are arranges into three subgroups according to the 
            openness of the arms. These subgroups are labeled SBa, SBb, and SBc. SBa galaxies have 
            a short bar of stars extending from the center while SBc galaxies have a long, well-defined 
            bar. Our own Milky Way galaxy is now believed to be a barred spiral galaxy.'

            elongated ovals. Unlike spiral galaxies, they have no bright nucleus at their center. 
            Elliptical galaxies are represented by the letter E and are divided into seven 
            subgroups according to their shape. These subgroups are labeled E0 to E7. E0 galaxies 
            nearly circular in shape while E7 galaxies are extremely elongated or stretched out.

            have no discernible shape or structure. Irregular galaxies are divided into two classes, 
            Im and IO. Im class galaxies are the most common and show just a hint of structure. 
            Sometimes the faint remnants of spiral arms can be seen. IO class galaxies are completely 
            chaotic in form. The large and small Magellanic Clouds are examples of Im class irregular galaxies.'
